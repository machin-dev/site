I’ve been meaning to make this for a really long time.

This website will act as a repository for my projects and my thoughts.
These will include write-ups, general notes, or just a random stream of
disjointed ideas.

====[ whoami ]======================================================================

I would describe myself as a programmer, my job title is "Lead Ruby Developer" 
but I like exploring other languages and technologies too. Who wouldn't? 

I'm sure a lot of you feel that if you stop yourself from learning you would fall
out of love with development. At least that's how I feel. I want to use this site to
document my explorations into different concepts and paradigms, shallow or not.

At my day job I focus on medical software, automation systems for dispensing pills.
Though most of my focus in my own time is in the logistics field.

If you would like to contact me or join any of my projects, or to start one fresh, 
I'd certainly be thrilled to hear from you.
